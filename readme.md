# MyPersonal Website Project

Code of my personal website that I created with Flask. 

## Default Settings
For default mode: 

- There is no database. (After running main.py database will be created)

- Author initialized as Gokay. You can change it in main.py file

## Admin Login
If you want to use the post creation and deletion features, you need to log in as an admin.

Here is how to login as admin:

- go to
http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or any local host)/admin_panel

- for a default login:
   !IMPORTANT: First delete the database then run.
   - username: admin
   - password: admin123admin
   - you can change the username and password in the main.py / admin_panel method
   - you have to delete the database to do that.
